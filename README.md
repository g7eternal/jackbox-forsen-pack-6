    + Note: if you want to preserve the original game content and install the new content alongside it, you will have to manually edit the matching files.
        + For Trivia Murder Party 2, you may want to merge the new questions with old ones (from the original game). For that you can copy the _TDQuestions.jet_ and _TDFinalRound.jet_ files from **\_dev** folder into **games\TriviaParty2\content** folder (replacing the existing files).
        + For other instances, the merging must be done manually. We hope you know what you're doing.

4. All done! Start up the game to confirm: installation has been successful if your game intro has changed.
